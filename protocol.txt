Answer with no error:
A status of "0" to specify everything is okay, plus a list of URL paths for request, validation job, etc.
A path is provided for error, job request, job validation, download needed file, heartbeat (keepmealive), logout, thumbnail of last frame rendered and how many credits have been earned so far.
The maximum duration between two heartbeats in seconds is given by the attribute "max-period".
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<config status="0">
    <request type="validate-job" path="/server/send_frame.php" />
    <request type="request-job" path="/server/request_job.php" />
    <request type="download-archive" path="/server/download.php" />
    <request type="error" path="/server/error.php" />
    <request type="keepmealive" path="/server/keepmealive.php" max-period="1440" />
    <request type="logout" path="/account.php?mode=logout&worker=1" />
    <request type="last-render-frame" path="/ajax.php?action=webclient_get_last_render_frame_ui&type=raw"/>
    <request type="credits-earned" path="/ajax.php?action=credits_earned_on_session"/>
</config>


=== Session end ===

Url: use the request type "download-archive" from the configuration answer.
Parameter as GET or POST:
    * type: "binary"
    * job: ID of the job

Answer:
No error: the file
On error: an 404 http code


=== Download job archive ===

Url: use the request type "download-archive" from the configuration answer.
Parameter as GET or POST:
    * type: "job"
    * job: ID of the job

Answer:
No error: the file
On error: an 404 http code


=== Job request ===

Url: use the request type "request-job" from the configuration answer.
Parameter as GET or POST:
    * computemethod: What compute types are available on this machine. 0 for CPU or GPU, 1 for CPU only, 2 for GPU only. 
    * cpu_cores: Number of cores currently available for rendering (optional).
    * gpu_type: GPU's type, usually CUDA or OPENCL
    * gpu_model: Model name of the GPU available for rendering
    * gpu_ram: GPU memory size (in bytes)

Answer in case of error:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<jobrequest status="X" />
where X:
    * 0   => No error
    * 200 => No job available, the client should wait few minutes before requesting a new job (typical value is 1hour).
    * 201 => The client does not have rendering right.
    * 202 => Client's session is dead. Client should send another config request before requesting a new job.
    * 203 => Client's session has been disabled (usually because the client is sending broken frames). The client should alert the end user and logout.
    * 205 => No renderer is available for Client's hardware (pair of OS and architecture). For example, Blender is not available for MacOS 32bits.
    * 206 => Server is in maintenance mode, and is not issuing jobs (but it will keep the session alive). Try again in a few minutes.
    * 207 => Server is overloaded, and is not issuing jobs (but it will keep the session alive). Try again in a few minutes.
    * something else => unknown error
